# Arnia Angular Training June

If you are looking for the first edition of the app and training, [refer to this repo](https://github.com/nechita/angular-training-march).

This repo consists of a bookmark manager, with CRUD like functionality. The app also emulates working with a RESTful api by using the `json-server` npm package.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` or `npm start` to start the Angular application and also the json server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. You can find information about the api by accessing `http://localhost:3000`.

## Code scaffolding

All the code scaffolding is the via Angular CLI. For more information about the CLI, refer to [their docs](https://cli.angular.io/).

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
